### Assignment Outline

Your final project post is worth 15% of your final grade. This final piece involves both submitting any code, data, or materials you have created for the project (only need to be submitted once if working in a group), and then writing a reflective blog post on your experiences of working on the project that will be posted on the course website.

While blog posts are usually seen as not very intellectual or rigorous, in digital humanities blogging has been a crucial way that scholars have shared information. Though I had to cut our session on blogging for time constraints, we have actually read a number of blog posts over the course of the semester:

- “Which Dh Tools Are Actually Used In Research?” By Laure Barbot, Frank Fischer, Yoann Moranville And Ivan Pozdniakov, December 6 2019 <https://weltliteratur.net/dh-tools-used-in-research/>
- Posner, Miriam (2015), “Humanities Data, a Necessary Contradiction” <https://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction/>
- Maciej Cegłowski “Haunted by Data” Idle Words October 1 2015 <https://idlewords.com/talks/haunted_by_data.htm>
- Giorgia Lupi *Data Humanism* <http://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold>
- Lincoln Mullen “Isn’t it obvious?” January 10, 2018 <https://lincolnmullen.com/blog/isnt-it-obvious/>
- Matthew Lincoln “Confabulation in the humanities” 21 Mar 2015 <https://matthewlincoln.net/2015/03/21/confabulation-in-the-humanities.html>
- Ted Underwood. “Seven ways humanists are using computers to understand text”. June 4, 2015 <https://tedunderwood.com/2015/06/04/seven-ways-humanists-are-using-computers-to-understand-text/>
- Maciej Cegłowski. “Deep Fried Data” Idle Words. September 27, 2016. <https://idlewords.com/talks/deep_fried_data.htm>
- Skallerup Bessette, Lee and Quinn Dombrowski. “DSC Multilingual Mystery 2: Beware, Lee and Quinn!”. February 27, 2020. <https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dscm2.html>

Using these posts as examples of how you can structure your post, you should write a post of 1000-1500 words and detail your experience of building the final project. This post is a chance to critically reflect on what worked in your final project and what did not, as well as what you might do in the future with this project. Ultimately, the post is intended to be a chance for you to articulate what you learned about computing in the humanities, digital humanities, and how we think and work with data in the humanities. To that end, the post should reference **at least four of the readings** from class and detail how your project impacted your understanding of digital humanities.

### Assignment Submission

Because the blog post format is public and also very personal, you are welcome to write in which ever way your feel comfortable (perhaps more informal with bullet points or with lots of images), but remember the goal is to still think critically about your experiences and your project. Even if you worked in a group, blog posts are individually authored, and you can certainly reflect on the experiences of either working collaboratively or solo. These final posts and all associated materials (links to code on Github, datasets, reference images) must be submitted by **MIDNIGHT on May 16**. If you submit later, I cannot guarantee I will have time to grade you before final grades are due, so PLEASE SUBMIT ON TIME!! Submissions should be written in Markdown and happy to provide support on formatting or embedding interactive visualizations.
