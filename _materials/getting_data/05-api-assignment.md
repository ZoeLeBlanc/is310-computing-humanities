*Reminder this is an optional assignment. But recommend completing it if you plan to work with APIs in your final project.*

1. Create a new script called `first_apis.py`. Now select an API from one of the following resources:
   - <https://github.com/chanonroy/cool-apis>
   - <https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis>
   - <https://apilist.fun/>
   - One of my personal favorites is SWAPI (the Star Wars API) <https://swapi.dev/documentation>.

2. After you pick an API, read through the documentation and find a way to get data from it. This could involve using requests to query the API directly or working with a code library and using the correct method. 
   - For APIs that require authentication, make sure you authenticate and store your API keys locally.

3. Once you have the data, subset the data so that you only have one item, print out the entirety of that item in your script, and then store it either as a JSON file or as a CSV file (choice is yours) with the filename that includes the API you selected.

4. Push both your script and the data to your Github repository.
