If you are new to using Markdown or have some questions about some syntax we have been using, I highly recommend you take a look at the following resources.

1. Sarah Simpkin, "Getting Started with Markdown," *Programming Historian* 4 (2015), <https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0046>.
2. Then for more depth, you could also check out the Markdown Guide's Getting Started page <https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/>
3. The Markdown Guide also has a series of helpful cheatsheets if you are looking for a quick reference:
    - Cheatsheet for Markdown Basics <https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/>
    - Basic Syntax <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/>
    - Extended Syntax <https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/>
4. And finally for Github-flavored Markdown (that is Markdown that is compatible with Github's Markdown syntax), you can check out <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>.

*Have any additional questions? Either ask them in our Discord or message the instructor*
