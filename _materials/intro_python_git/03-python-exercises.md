*Few guidelines for working in groups*

- Finishing first doesn't matter, what matters is working together
- If you know the answer, give others a chance to work it out for themselves
- If none of you know the answer, try reading the course materials and asking for help for the instructor

### Exercise 1 

1. Create two variables containing strings. Decide how to name the variables
2. Check if the variables are equal to one another
3. Concatenate the strings.
4. Get the length of this new string.

**SWITCH**
Now next person types, other person decides what to type

1. Create two variables containing integers
2. Check if they are equal to one another
3. Multiply the integers
4. Add a float to this new integer
5. Check the type of this new integer

### Exercise 2

1. Create a python script using the Command Line. Call the script `new_script.py`.
2. Recreate the steps from exercise 1
3. BUT use the `input` method so that users can choose the initial values for both the strings and integers variables
4. AND use the `print` method to print out in the terminal each step of the exercise
