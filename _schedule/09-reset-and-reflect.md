## Class Activities

*This session differs from the original syllabus so that we can focus on catching up on some of the coding concepts for the final project. Readings will be moved to subsequent weeks.*

The goal for this class session is to get us far through Python and Git as possible. I will assign exact materials closer to the class, but feel free to browse both the section [Introduction to Python and Git]({{site.baseurl}}/materials/intro-python-git/02-beggining-python) and [Advanced Python]({{site.baseurl}}/materials/advanced-python/01-more-python) to get a sense of what we'll be covering.
